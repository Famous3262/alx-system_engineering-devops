Here is the postmortem report for the recent web server outage:

[Issue Summary:]()

The web server outage lasted from `October 9th, 2023 at 8:30 PM WAT` to `October 10th, 2023 at 11:45 AM WAT.`
During this time, our e-commerce website was down, resulting in a complete loss of service for all users.
The root cause of the outage was a `misconfiguration` in the load balancer.

[Timeline:]()

On `October 9th, 2023 at 8:30 PM WAT` - The issue was first detected by a monitoring alert.
Our team, headed by Adama Famous(aka Famebrain) immediately started investigating the issue, assuming it was a database problem.
After several hours of investigation, we realized that the database was not the issue and started looking into other potential causes.
Unfortunately, we went down several misleading paths before discovering the misconfiguration in the load balancer.
The incident was escalated to our senior engineers and management team for assistance.
On `October 10th, 2023 at 11:45 AM WAT` - The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer.

[Root Cause and Resolution:]()

The root cause of the outage was a misconfiguration in the load balancer.
Specifically, it was set to route all traffic to a single server, which caused it to become overloaded and crash.
The issue was resolved by reconfiguring the load balancer to evenly distribute traffic across all available servers.

[Corrective and Preventive Measures:]()

To prevent similar outages in the future, we will be implementing the following corrective and preventive measures:

* Improve our monitoring system to include more detailed alerts for load balancing issues.
* Conduct regular audits of our load balancer configurations to ensure they are properly set up.
* Implement automated testing for load balancing configurations to catch any issues before they cause an outage.
* Provide additional training for our team on load balancing best practices.

In conclusion, we apologize for any inconveniences caused by this outage,
and we are taking steps to ensure it does not happen again in the future.
We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to improve our systems.
And remember, if all else fails, there's always good old-fashioned pen and paper!
